# Compiling / Building

When you need to compile the program, do so by running `make`. The [Makefile](mdc:Makefile)'s default target will ensure the project is built correctly.

# Running

After compiling, you may run the program if you'd like.

When you want to run the program, first ensure that any existing instances are stopped:

```bash
pkill print-dis
```

Then, run it with the following invocation:

```bash
bin/print-dis --log-level debug --spoolman-enabled --spoolman-endpoint https://spoolman.cmdcentral.xyz
```
